						<p>Heads turned as Gary Kremen stepped into his office, dressed in a rainbow tie-dyed tee. The founder of online dating site <a href

It was during this infamous Q&A that the CEO would unwittingly predict the future. He looked into the camera and, making eye contact with the audience watching at home, uttered words more truth than he ever could have realized:</p>

						<p>As online dating became destigmatized and the number of users grew, a variety of cohorts joined Match.com in the world of data-driven dating. One of the most famous, eHarmony, arrived in August 2000, founded by clinical psychologist Dr. Neil Clark Warren and his son-in law. Known for its lengthy application process, including a  questionnaire that once included 450 questions, it became the first algorithm-based dating site. At its height, the service boasted 33 million users. In 2015, it was reported that 71% of women and 69% of men met their spouse <a href="https://www.datingadvice.com/online-dating/eharmony-success-rate" target="_blank">within a year</a> of creating an eHarmony account.</p>

By 2013, an estimated <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/martinzwilling/2013/03/01/how-many-more-online-dating-sites-do-we-need/#3b7442c87882" target="_blank">8,000</a> online dating services were available worldwide, 2,500 of which existed in the U.S.</p>

Users later have the option to fill out additional questions on a variety of topics, ranging from lifestyle choices to questions like "What's better: Kissing in Paris, or kissing in a tent in the woods?"
