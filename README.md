# onlinedating
What is this project about?
This project will discuss the popularity and usage of dating apps in the United States as of 2017.  

Who is the project for? 
The project is for those interested in analyzing and understanding online dating.  
Why is the project being done? Online dating is an increasingly important part of the new generation’s social environment. In the past few years, it has grown from being considered an unattractive option to a widely-accepted one; soon, it may very well grow to be the main way that people meet significant others and friends.   

What areas of your topic are you going to cover?
I plan on splitting my site into two sections. 
The first section, the introductory information, will give a brief history of online dating since the first major site, Match.com, launched in 1995. It will then go on to give some statistics on how the popularity of online dating has grown since its creation. 

The second section will first analyze online dating usage as of 2017, breaking data down by more traditional statistics, such as overall audience size, gender, sexual orientation, age, and location. Then, I will answer the question that may be on hopeful swipers’ minds: how many people actually end up finding love?  

What types of data are you going to look at? 
I plan on using data from a number of sources, combining more data-heavy sources like Statista with research conducted by online publications like the New York Times and The Business of Apps.  

What other information do you want to show? 
I want my final project to be both informational and emotional. Online dating can be playful, stressful, exciting, confusing, and hope-inspiring. I hope to share data that will shed light on the environment as it truly is and help enlighten my audience on what they will find should they choose to participate. For that reason, I find it important to include both data on simple numbers and data on failures and successes.
